# resurv-replication-code

This repository contains the code to replicate the simulated case study of the manuscript *A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH BASED ON SURVIVAL ANALYSIS FOR IBNR FREQUENCIES IN NON-LIFE RESERVING*.

The computations for obtaining the results in the manuscript were performed on the ERDA cloud (see Appendix *Computational Details* of the manuscript).

> We do not share the private data on which we performed the real data case study.

The repository is organised as follows:

## Running on Slurm

The jobs were executed with the Slurm scheduler. To replicate our workflow:

1. **Perform Bayesian hyper-parameter tuning for each dataset in each scenario.** Example `.sh` files for simulation Alpha can be found in `slurm_scripts`. Submit with `sbatch ~/slurm_job_init_cv.sh`. The companion script `slurm_job_cv.sh` shows how to launch the subsequent cross-validation jobs. Both serve as templates for creating similar submission scripts for other simulations.
2. **Fit and score the models.** Example `.sh` files that fit and score chain ladder and ReSurv-based models are provided in `slurm_scripts`. Execute `sbatch ~/simulation_fitting_scoring_slurm.sh` (or adapt `simulation_fitting_scoring.sh` for interactive runs).
3. **Save the final results in a LaTeX-friendly format.** Run `Fitting_Scoring/summarize_simulation_results.R` after the simulations complete.
